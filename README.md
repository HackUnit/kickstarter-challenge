# Kickstarting with Excel

## The Purpose and Overview of the Project

This project at its core is designed to help an up and coming playwrite, Louise, to establish the best solution for crowdfunding her play: "Fever". She had already done her own budget calculations, but arrived at a number over $10,000, which is a daunting proposition in of itself.
To help Louise have a successful campaign and find the right number for her budget, a dataset of a variety of media types that were crowdfunded was used. This was then organized, sorted and analyzed to help find the most successful campaign path for her and her play.
